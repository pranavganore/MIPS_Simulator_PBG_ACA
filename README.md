Objective : 
            To experience the design issues of advanced computer architectures through the design of an analyzer for a simplified MIPS CPU using high level programming languages. The considered MIPS CPU adopts a multi-cycle pipeline processor to dynamically schedule instruction execution and employs caches in order to expedite memory access.
